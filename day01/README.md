The only .txt file that is needed to run this, is the cal-count.txt in the same folder as the shell 
script.

#### Linux users

Make sure to make the script executable by running `sudo chmod+x cal-count.sh` before running the 
command.

To run the script open a terminal where you saved the file and run `./cal-count.sh`.
