The only .txt file that is needed to run this, is the cal-count.txt in the same folder as the shell 
script.

#### Linux users

Make sure to make the script executable by running `sudo chmod+x cal-count.sh` before running the 
command.

To run the script open a terminal where you saved the file and run `./cal-count.sh`.

To try this script with your advent of code input; just overwrite the `cal-count.txt` with whatever 
input you have.
