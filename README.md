Hey, first time participating in the Advent of Code and I hate myself so I am learning and using 
Git for this event. I honestly don't have a set language I want to work in so I will most likely 
be jumping around from language to language; hell I may even throw in some shell script for fun. 
I plan to seperate out the days into different folders to try and keep things tidy.
